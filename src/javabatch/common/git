*********************
What is Git?
Git is a version control system that helps developers track changes to their code,
collaborate with others, and manage different versions of a project.

Features:
1. Tracks changes: Keeps a history of all edits made to files.
2. Supports branching and merging: Lets developers create separate "branches" to work on new features
 or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase.
3. Distributed: Every developer has a full copy of the repository, which means you can work offline
 and sync changes later.
4. Collaboration-friendly: Works well with services like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket to coordinate
 work across teams.
